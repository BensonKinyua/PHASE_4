# Project Overview: Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Introduction
In the era of information overload, social media platforms like Twitter have become a valuable source of unstructured data that can provide insights into public opinions, trends, and sentiments. Twitter sentiment analysis is a Data Science project aimed at extracting meaningful information from Twitter data by analyzing the sentiment expressed in tweets. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining whether a given text conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine. In this project, we will perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data for Apple and Google products. 
## Business Understanding:

In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become powerful tools for individuals, businesses, and organizations to share information, connect with their audience, and express their opinions. Twitter, with its millions of daily active users, generates a massive amount of text data in the form of tweets. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into public opinion, market trends, and brand perception.

One crucial aspect of this data analysis is sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet. For businesses and organizations, understanding the sentiment of tweets related to their products, services, or brand is essential. It can help them:

* Customer Feedback: Gain insights into customer opinions and feedback, enabling them to improve products and services.

* Brand Monitoring: Monitor and manage their online reputation by identifying positive and negative mentions of their brand.

* Competitive Analysis: Compare their brand's sentiment with competitors, identifying areas for improvement or potential advantages.

* Crisis Management: Detect and respond to potential PR crises by identifying negative sentiment trends early.

* Campaign Analysis: Analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by tracking changes in sentiment over time.

* Market Research: Conduct market research by analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to a particular product or topic.
## Problem Statement:
In the age of social media, Twitter has become a prominent platform for users to express their opinions and feelings about various products and brands. Apple and Google, two of the world's leading technology companies, constantly release new products and updates that generate significant online chatter. Analyzing the sentiment of Twitter users towards these companies' products is crucial for both companies and consumers. Therefore, the problem statement focuses on conducting sentiment analysis for Apple and Google products using Twitter data. 

Apple and Google are global giants in the technology industry, known for their innovative products, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, software, and more. Understanding how consumers perceive their products on Twitter is essential for these companies to gauge public sentiment and make informed decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and customer support.

The primary problem is to develop a robust sentiment analysis system that can automatically assess the sentiment of Twitter users' posts (tweets) towards Apple and Google products. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the public's perception of these products, helping both companies and consumers make informed decisions.

### Expected Impact:
By successfully addressing this problem statement, we aim to provide valuable insights to both Apple and Google, enabling them to:
* Make data-driven decisions for product development and marketing strategies.
* Identify areas for improvement in their products based on customer feedback.
* Enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* Stay competitive in the ever-evolving technology market.

Additionally, consumers and tech enthusiasts will benefit from access to real-time sentiment analysis, helping them make informed decisions when purchasing Apple and Google products.
## Defining the metrics for success:
The success of a Twitter sentiment analysis project for Apple and Google products can be measured using a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. These metrics will help assess the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis system and its impact on both companies and consumers. Here are the key metrics of success:

Accuracy of Sentiment Analysis Model:

Metric: Accuracy
Definition: The proportion of correctly classified tweets (positive, negative, neutral) by the sentiment analysis model.
Target: Achieve a high level of accuracy to ensure reliable sentiment classification.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:

Metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
Definition: These metrics provide a more detailed understanding of model performance, especially for imbalanced datasets. Precision measures the ratio of true positive predictions, recall measures the ratio of correctly identified positive instances, and the F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Target: Aim for a balance between precision and recall to minimize false positives and false negatives in sentiment classification.
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a robust sentiment analysis system that can automatically assess the sentiment of Twitter users' posts (tweets) towards Apple and Google products. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the public's perception of these products, helping both companies and consumers make informed decisions.

The primary goal is to assess the sentiment, opinions, and emotions of Twitter users regarding Apple and Google products.
## Data Understanding:
The data for this project was available in data world. The dataset has four columns;
* tweet_id: Unique ID for each tweet
* tweet_text: Text content of the tweet
* product: Product mentioned in the tweet (Apple or Google)
* sentiment: Sentiment of the tweet (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
The exploratory data analysis process for this project involved the following steps:
* Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned by removing duplicate tweets, removing special characters, and removing URLs.
* Data Transformation: The data was transformed by converting all text to lowercase, removing stop words, and lemmatizing the text.
* Data Visualization: The data was visualized using word clouds and bar charts to gain insights into the most common words and sentiments in the dataset.

## Data Visualization:
The data visualization process for this project involved the following steps:
* Word Clouds: Word clouds were used to visualize the most common words in the dataset.
* Bar Charts: Bar charts were used to visualize the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Models
Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly; they require numerical input data. Therefore, before we can build a sentiment analysis model, we need to transform the tweets into a format that is suitable for machine learning. This involves two steps: 
1.  tokenizing the strings
2. vectorizing the tokens.

## Models Used
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
* Ada Boost Classifier
* Support Vector Machine with GridSearchCV

## Model Evaluation and Optimization
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
* Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified tweets (positive, negative, neutral) by the sentiment analysis model.
* Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions.
* Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances.
* F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Conclusion
In this project, we have developed a robust sentiment analysis system that can automatically assess the sentiment of Twitter users' posts (tweets) towards Apple and Google products. This analysis provides valuable insights into the public's perception of these products, helping both companies and consumers make informed decisions.
